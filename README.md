# VIP Club
My third original project using Express/Node and MongoDB with Passport, this is a website made to practice core concepts such as authentication and authorization of users.

It is a message board where anyone can view messages, but only registered users can post messages and only VIP users can view the authors and post date of the messages. Admin accounts can delete messages.

## Features
1. CRUD operations in MongoDB
2. User authentication and authorization using PassportJS + sessions
3. Model-view-controller architecture
